          I began my Software Development career {years} years ago, and since
          then I have worked on embedded systems in C++, delivered operational
          software tools to improve safety of flight in the United States Air
          Force, built complex web applications in React / Typescript, and
          crafted system architecture for large & complex projects. Currently, I
          am finishing 8 years in the US Air Force on a fellowship as a Product
          Owner and Scrum Master at{" "}
